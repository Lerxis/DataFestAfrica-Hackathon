# DataFestAfrica-Hackathon
I participated in the recently concluded DataFest Africa Hackathon that held on the Kaggle platform and the task was outlined as follows:
BACKGROUND
You just got hired as a Data Scientist at Borrowme, a fintech playing in the lending space. The CEO tasks you with helping to revamp the lending process due to complaints from customers on the time the process takes
TASK
The IT team has provided historical information containing the information of applicants and the status of their loan application process. You are expected to automate the process by building a machine learning model to predict the outcome of the lending process if the credit facility process was completed via e-process, that is E-Signed or not.
A train dataset was provided to create and train your machine learning model on and a test dataset was also provided without its labels to be able to test the performance of the machine learning model you created.
I approached this task using various machine learning models such as Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting and Adaptive Boosting Methods and Logistic Regression. Overall, I settled on using a Voting Classifier which combines results from various classification machine learning models and draws its prediction from each of them. This earned my team and I a spot to participate in the next round of the competition which focused mainly on data visualization.
The jupyter notebook containing my work is also provided in this folder.
